# Getting help with introspector

Thanks for using introspector!
Before filing an issue, there are a few places to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Make a reprex

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample; consider using the  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 

For reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site. They have more practice giving advice here than I do! 

## Where to ask?

*   If it's a bug or a feature request, [file an issue](https://github.com/cyrusae/introspector/issues/new).  
  
*   If you're not sure: consider asking StackOverflow or other community forums!
    If your problem _is_ a bug or a feature request, you can easily return here and report it. 

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/cyrusae/introspector/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. 
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)  (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. 
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.
